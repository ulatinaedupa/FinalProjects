# Titanic Survivors Prediction

## 📋 Description
Classic machine learning problem analyzing the Titanic disaster dataset to predict passenger survival. This project demonstrates data analysis, feature engineering, and classification techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict passenger survival based on demographic and ticket information
- Perform feature engineering and data cleaning
- Compare multiple classification algorithms

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

## 📦 Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## 🚀 Execution
Run the analysis notebook/script which includes:
- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering (family size, titles, etc.)
- Model training and comparison
- Prediction and submission

## 📊 Dataset Features
- **Pclass:** Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex:** Gender
- **Age:** Passenger age
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard
- **Fare:** Ticket price
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation
- **Cabin:** Cabin number

## 📈 Analysis Insights
- Survival rates by class, gender, and age
- Feature correlation analysis
- Impact of family size on survival
- Model comparison and selection
