# Cat Dog Classifier CNN

## 📋 Description
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification that distinguishes between cats and dogs. This project demonstrates deep learning for computer vision tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build and train a CNN for image classification
- Implement data preprocessing and augmentation
- Achieve high accuracy in cat vs dog classification

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Libraries:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, PIL
- **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 📦 Requirements
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib pillow jupyter
```

## 🚀 Execution
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Model Classifier Perros o Gatos.ipynb"
```
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. The notebook includes data loading, model training, and evaluation

## 📊 Results
- Training accuracy and loss curves
- Validation performance metrics
- Sample predictions with visualization
