# Heart Attack Prediction

## 📋 Description
Predictive analytics system for cardiovascular health risk assessment. Uses machine learning to identify individuals at high risk of heart attack based on medical parameters.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a classification model for heart attack risk prediction
- Identify key risk factors through feature analysis
- Provide accurate predictions for clinical decision support

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Techniques:** Classification, feature selection, cross-validation

## 📦 Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## 🚀 Execution
Execute the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Results visualization

## 📊 Input Features
Typical cardiovascular risk factors:
- Age and gender
- Cholesterol levels
- Blood pressure
- Heart rate
- ECG results
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression

## 📈 Model Performance
Evaluation includes:
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
- ROC curves
- Feature importance analysis
